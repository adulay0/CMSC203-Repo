/*
 * Class: CMSC 203
 * Instructor: Ahmed Tarek
 * Description: This is an Assignment 1 - ESP Game program. The public class ESPGame will display an interface, asking user to input
 * data. The game consists simply of the program generating a random color, in which the user must guess the color from a list of choices.
 * Due 9/18/24
 * Platform/Compiler: Windows Platform
 * I pledge that I have completed the programming assignment independently. I have not copied the code from a student or any source. I have
 * not given my code to any student.
 * Print your name here: Abigail Dulay
